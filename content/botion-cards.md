I wanted to fuse my electronic design with networking, so I made a NFC-powered business card. 

I have also published the [app to program them](https://abenstirling.com/posts/botionnfc/), available on the App Store.

I was excited to see the [Envision Makerspace](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/envision/team-building) pilot them for their team building events!

I have currently archived them due to my lack of marketing abilities, but will make them for my favorite co-workers in the future.
