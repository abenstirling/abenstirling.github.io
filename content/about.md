### Hey, Ben Stirling here!

![Ben](/ben_summer_2024.jpg)

I am born and raised in sunny San Diego, CA.

I got my degree in Computer Engineering from UC San Diego.

I really enjoy building products. This is because building a product is obviously harder than building a project. When I subject myself to other people's standards, they often aren't higher than my own, which is why selling comes without much trouble.

What am I doing now?
Working on [metal 3D printing](https://fabric8labs.com)!
