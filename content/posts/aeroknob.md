My good CEO friend and I built a FlightSim controller from scratch. 

The CEO had a background in flight simulation and electrical engineering, and I had a background in mechanical design and software. We decided to team up and build a controller that was more realistic than the current offerings.

He started by designing the electrical system, which included a custom PCB and a custom firmware. I started by designing the mechanical system, which included a custom knob and a custom mounting system.

The mechanical design was accelerated by my Bambu Mini [3D Printer](https://bambulab.com/en-us/a1-mini), and the Fablight Metal [Laser Cutter](https://fablight3d.com/). The mechanical design was iterated on multiple times, and the final design was a combination of 3D printed parts and laser cut parts.

The final product was a huge success. The controller was more realistic than the current offerings, and the demand was high.

Given the demand, we launched our site [Aeroknob.com](https://aeroknob.com) and have been selling them and have since paid off our R&D costs, which is a huge win for us.
