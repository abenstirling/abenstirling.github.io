Opentags is the open-source AirTag. 

The goal is to have a fully open-source AirTag that can be used with any device, android or iOS.



The project is currently in the early stages, but we have made incredible progress just this year on both the software and hardware side. 

Feel free to star and follow along on the [Github](https://github.com/open-tags) page.
