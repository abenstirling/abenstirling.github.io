This is a quick project that [Ari](https://github.com/AriYoung00) and I built. [Link to repo:](https://github.com/abenstirling/macropad)

We built it with the [Keyboard Club Event](https://kbd.news/meetup/UCSD-Keebs-Nightmare-Before-Keebs-Meet-122.html) as the deadline. 

We went through several iterations, in software and hardware. 

Here was the first PCB:

It had a scuffed USB-C arrangement, also we switched to use a epaper display. 

The second PCB was better, still a bit off though:

Main issues were: 
- TP2 and TP3 were reversed (spliced the cable)
- Bad solder joints on headphone jack (resoldered)
- Lights were 180 degrees off (resoldered)
- Ruined epaper display with wrong code 
- Case needed to be adjusted to fit headphone jack (redesigned and printed 2x)

Nevertheless, we are stoked to see how it turned out for the event!
