### Problem: **Garage Parking is difficult and dangerous**

Having a tight parking garage and having to perfectly position the vehicle to have enough space to get out while trying to maximize usable space and not risk dents and scratches, not even including the fact that north of 20% of accidents occur in parking situations.

### Solution:

We want to provide drivers with accurate distance from their desired parking spot through an app interface. We are using the UWB (Ultra-Wide Bluetooth) protocol to do the localization, standard bluetooth to communicate from the device to the phone, and swift to power the app.
