I published BotionNFC to the App Store on 2/1/2024. It is a simple, open-source app that allows you to write NFC tags.

If you would like to try it out, you can download it here: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/botionnfc/id6476791734)

You can view the source code here: [Github](https://github.com/abenstirling/BotionNFC)
