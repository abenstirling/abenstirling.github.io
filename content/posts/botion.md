## I Wrote An App Because I Didn't Have One.

I have since published the app to the App Store. You can download it here: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/botion-checklist/id6477213069)

Some features include: 
- Notion OAuth Sign-in
- A simple task list, synced with your Notion page

It is simple but that is my goal. I use it every day and it has been a huge help for focusing on what I need to do.
