AI-powered date planning app.

Why did I make this? Welp, you never want your girlfriend to be bored.

### Tech Stack

I mean really. A computer engineer who makes a GPT wrapper app? So lame. But... it does have pictures. And you can save date cards. And you can share dates. It is honestly pretty cool, but I'm biased of course. But I use it!

### Advertising

This is a really deep question:

- _How does one find the product and the market fit?_

I have no idea.

Here is what I tried:

1. Talking to people!
   Thank you to all my friends and family who put up with crappy ui & a somewhat non-functional app. They helped me validate what worked and what didn't and what I should do. There was a balance, but since it is just a relatavely simple webapp, I added just about every feature that was requested. I still can, shoot me a message if you want something added.
2. Social Media... yeah this didn't work.
3. Flyers at UCSD. This seems to have worked, got a bunch of good reactions from people who saw it initially.
