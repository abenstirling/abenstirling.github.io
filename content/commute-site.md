This was the first profitable software software [Sam](https://github.com/sammcdo) and I made together. 

Here is a version of the site that is still live and hosted through this site: [commute.site](/commute/about.html) 

In 2019, my Dad was moving offices. A difficult decision is to figure out how long a move would change everyone's commute. We made a tool to help him decide.

The tool was a simple web app that took in a list of addresses and calculated the average commute time between them. It used the Google Maps API to get the commute times.

The tool was a hit. We made a few hundred dollars to make it, and even got in touch with a few CEOs of commercial real estate companies who were interested in white-labeling it.

We never pursued that, but it was a fun project to work on together.
