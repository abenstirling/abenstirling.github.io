      <description>I am taking a very interesting computer graphics course class and finally learned about curves.
Why do I care? Well, my background is in Computer Aided Design (CAD) and machining, so I have always been interested in the .STL file format which . I had always used the buzzword &amp;ldquo;interpolation&amp;rdquo; without really understanding what it meant.
From my understanding, interpolation is used when we have a set of data points and we need to estimate values between these points.</description>

      <description>This is a quick project that Ari and I built. Link to repo:
We built it with the Keyboard Club Event as the deadline.
We went through several iterations, in software and hardware.
Here was the first PCB: It had a scuffed USB-C arrangement, also we switched to use a epaper display.
The second PCB was better, still a bit off though: Main issues were:
TP2 and TP3 were reversed (spliced the cable) Bad solder joints on headphone jack (resoldered) Lights were 180 degrees off (resoldered) Ruined epaper display with wrong code Case needed to be adjusted to fit headphone jack (redesigned and printed 2x) Nevertheless, we are stoked to see how it turned out for the event!</description>

      <title>PCB Business Card</title>

      <description>I Made a Business Card Because I Didn&amp;rsquo;t Have One. The thought behind this one is that I needed a way to stand out. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a bit of a non-traditional student, and my background is unique. I wanted to highlight how I build real things. I don&amp;rsquo;t just build real things, I ship real things.
I initially started with just a bare PCB with a QR code. Everyone always asked, &amp;ldquo;Does it work?</description>

      <description>I built a coffee table with my girlfriend.
Frankly, we stole the idea from another couple that did the exact same thing.
Speaking of the exact same thing, they gave us their leftover lacuer.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sponsored by them, so that is why the picture is blurry.
I moved into CAD, as things naturally start.
It was a &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; build.

      <description>I Made a Pick + Place Machine Because My University Didn&amp;rsquo;t Have One. | ðŸ’¡ Update: Join the Pick + Place Club Of UCSD: https://discord.gg/KQ8bMdYnwB
The main requirements:
Be useful Be somewhat affordable Be finish-able I have followed Stephen Hawes on youtube since 2020, and have danced around with the idea of making his pick and place since it was open source.
After he launched his company, I figured I could order the COTS parts and machine the rest at my school makerspace.</description>

      <description>Problem: Garage Parking is difficult and dangerous Having a tight parking garage and having to perfectly position the vehicle to have enough space to get out while trying to maximize usable space and not risk dents and scratches, not even including the fact that north of 20% of accidents occur in parking situations.
Solution: We want to provide drivers with accurate distance from their desired parking spot through an app interface.</description>
