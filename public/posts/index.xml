      <description>I Made a Pick + Place Machine Because My University Didn&amp;rsquo;t Have One. | ðŸ’¡ Update: Join the Pick + Place Club Of UCSD: https://discord.gg/KQ8bMdYnwB
The main requirements:
Be useful Be somewhat affordable Be finish-able I have followed Stephen Hawes on youtube since 2020, and have danced around with the idea of making his pick and place since it was open source.
After he launched his company, I figured I could order the COTS parts and machine the rest at my school makerspace.</description>

      <description>Problem: Garage Parking is difficult and dangerous Having a tight parking garage and having to perfectly position the vehicle to have enough space to get out while trying to maximize usable space and not risk dents and scratches, not even including the fact that north of 20% of accidents occur in parking situations.
Solution: We want to provide drivers with accurate distance from their desired parking spot through an app interface.</description>
