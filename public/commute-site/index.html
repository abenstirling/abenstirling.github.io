<p>This was the first profitable software software <a href="https://github.com/sammcdo">Sam</a> and I made together.</p>
<p>Here is a version of the site that is still live and hosted through this site: <a href="/commute/about.html">commute.site</a></p>
<p>In 2019, my Dad was moving offices. A difficult decision is to figure out how long a move would change everyone's commute. We made a tool to help him decide.</p>
<p>The tool was a simple web app that took in a list of addresses and calculated the average commute time between them. It used the Google Maps API to get the commute times.</p>
<p>The tool was a hit. We made a few hundred dollars to make it, and even got in touch with a few CEOs of commercial real estate companies who were interested in white-labeling it.</p>
<p>We never pursued that, but it was a fun project to work on together.</p>
